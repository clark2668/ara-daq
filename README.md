# ara-daq
A fully functional distribution of the ARA daq system (Firmware, sotware, etc.) for the next generation of ARA Stations.

**Please note** that two of the respositories (atri-pcie and ArafeMasterSoftware) are submodules. So, when you clone this repository, you must do `git clone --recursive https://github.com/osu-particle-astrophysics/ara-daq.git`.
